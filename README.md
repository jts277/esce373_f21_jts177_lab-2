# esce373_f21_jts177_lab-2
this is the repo for Justin Stanko's lab 2 for modern robotic programming

To use tbe able to view the robot in this file you will need to have a version of ROS melodic melodies or sooner. You will also need a Catkin workspace enabled to run the file.
These files need the packages RVIZ as well to use with rosrun.

There are two types of the files using a urdf or using xacro macros.

to initalize the file you will also need the command run roslaunch launch.launch to search for the correct environments.

Thanks for reading
